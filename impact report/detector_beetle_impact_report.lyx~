\begin_layout Standard
The coconut rhinoceros beetle was first discovered on Guam in 2007.
 Adults kill palms when they bore into crowns to feed on sap.
 Rhino beetle larvae feed only on dead plant material at breeding sites
 and they do no damage.
 In order to eradicate rhino beetles, all breeding sites must be found and
 destroyed.
 Four dogs were trained to lead handlers to cryptic breeding sites on Guam.
 This detector dog program was effective but very expensive and it was shut
 down after a couple of years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aubrey Moore, a UOG entomologist, suggested following radio-tagged rhino
 beetles to breeding sites as a cost-effective alternative to using detector
 dogs.
 In August 2015 this idea was tested in a small feasability study on Guam
 by a research team which included Moore, Dr.
 Matthew Siderhurst and his students, Kat Lehmann and Diego Barahona from
 Eastern Mennonite University, VA, Domenick Skabeikis from the USDA Pacific
 Basin Research Center in Hilo, HI and UOG technician Ian Iriarte.

\begin_layout Standard
During the 10 day field trial, miniature radio transmitters were glued to
 the backs of rhino beetles (inset in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Radio-tagged-rhinoceros-beetle.-1"

\end_inset

).
 These beetles were released at the UOG Agricultural Experiment Station
 in Yigo and at the Asan Beach Park and their locations were tracked for
 a few days using special radio receivers equipped with directional antennas
 (Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Radio-tagged-rhinoceros-beetle.-1"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of beetles were tracked to coconut trees which had already
 been damaged by rhino beetles.
 A few other beetles quickly flew beyond the detection range of the receivers
 and were never recovered.
 As hoped, several beetles lead the team to cryptic breeding sites.
 The transmitter from one of the first beetles to be released was found
 the next day in a hole in a rotting branch of a breadfruit about 20 feet
 above the ground.
 Three other adult beetles were found in the same hole indicating that the
 beetles had aggregated here to establish a new breeding site.
 According to Moore,

It is very likely that the breadfruit branch was broken during Typhoon Dolphin
 which visited Guam in May 2015.
 If this is the case, there must be thousands of new, miniature breeding
 sites in Guam's jungles resulting from typhoon damage.
 These breeding sites will be generating large numbers of adult rhino beetles
 within the next several months.

 Another unexpected result from the field trial is the fact that none of
 the 30 tagged beetles were caught in traps, even though all were released
 within pheromone trapping grids.
 This indicates that rhino beetle pheromone traps may be useful for detection
 and surveillance but are ineffective for population control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cryptic breeding sites can be found by following radio-tagged beetles and
 this method may be a critical to the success of eradication attempts on
 a recently invaded islands.
