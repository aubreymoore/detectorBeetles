   <p><b><b>Record Method</b></b>: Sets a track recording method. <b>Auto</b> records the tracks at a variable rate to create an optimum representation of your tracks.</p>
<p><b><b>Interval</b></b>: Sets a track log recording rate. Recording points more frequently creates a more-detailed track, but fills the track log faster.</p>
<p><b><b>Auto Pause</b></b>: Pauses tracking automatically when you stop moving. </p>
<p><b><b>Auto Start</b></b>: Starts recording a track automatically when the device has acquired satellites. </p>
<p><b><b>Output Format</b></b>: Allows you to choose the format for recording a track log. <b>GPX</b> format is a traditional track that can be viewed on the device map and used for navigation. Tracks are reviewed using Track Manager. <b>FIT</b> format is a fitness activity that records additional information (for example, laps). Activities can be reviewed on the device, but are tailored for Garmin Connect™. You can select <b>Both</b> to record your data in both formats simultaneously. This option uses more storage space.</p>
<p><b><b>Advanced Setup</b></b>: Allows you to set up automatic archiving, set up when to record trip data, and reset trip data.</p>
